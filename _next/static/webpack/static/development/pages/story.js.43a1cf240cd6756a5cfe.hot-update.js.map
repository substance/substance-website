He was dissatisfied with LaTeX, Microsoft Word and various Markdown flavours for writing his master thesis and decided to work on an alternative that puts semantics first, and lets the writer focus on content and structure while leaving formatting and style to the system entirely.\n          </Contributor>\n          <Contributor img='oliver.jpeg'>\n            In the year 2013 Oliver Buchtala joined the project and together they started turning a then-hobby project into a serious business. In 2014 Substance Software GmbH founded to provide consulting around the open source project, which turned from a platform into a Javascript library for building web editors.\n          </Contributor>\n        </Section>\n        <Section headline='Contributors'>\n          <Contributor img='daniel.jpeg'>\n            Daniel Beilinson is a Substance contributor since the beginning.
