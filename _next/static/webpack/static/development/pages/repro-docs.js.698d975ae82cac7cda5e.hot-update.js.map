Therefore, Substance in collaboration with Stencila is developing an extension to the <Link href='/dar'><a>DAR</a></Link> format, which will allow the data, code and computed outputs (graphs, statistical results, tables) embedded in a reproducible document to be recognised and presented online as an enhanced version of the published research article. In order to do this, we are representing these assets in JATS XML, the publishing standard through which research manuscripts are processed through the publishing workflow.\n        </Section>\n        <Section headline='Stencila'>\n          <Link href='https://stenci.la/'><a>Stencila</a></Link> is an open source platform, which provides easy-to-access computation environments for reproducible documents in the <Link href='/dar'><a>DAR</a></Link> format. Stencila makes reproducibility an integral part of a research publication (with live code execution) rather than attaching supplementary programming notebooks. Stencila however is capable of reading and writing existing well-established notebook formats such as Jupyter, RMarkdown etc.\n        </Section>\n        <Section headline='Stencila in Texture'>\n        Substance is developing a Stencila plugin for Texture, which enables reproducible content types in the editor. It provides a seamless editing experience for both regular text and source code.\n        </Section>\n        <Section headline='Learn more'>\n          <ReadMore href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00724-7' title='Pioneering ‘live-code’ article allows scientists to play with each other’s results' />\n          <ReadMore href='https://elifesciences.org/labs/ad58f08d/introducing-elife-s-first-computationally-reproducible-article' title='Introducing eLife‘s first computationally reproducible research' />\n          <ReadMore href='https://elifesciences.org/labs/7dbeb390/reproducible-document-stack-supporting-the-next-generation-research-article' title='Reproducible Document Stack - supporting the next generation research article' />\n        </Section>\n      </Body>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
