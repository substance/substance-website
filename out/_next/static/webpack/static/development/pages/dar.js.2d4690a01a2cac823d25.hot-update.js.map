A modern published article however requires structured metadata such as authors, affiliations, references and journal information to be available. Publishers typically make use of the JATS-XML standard to capture that information. As a result a costly and slow conversion process is needed to turn a DOCX submission into structured XML.</p>\n          <p>If researchers and publishers could all use a shared file format, documents can be created and shared directly without friction. Furthermore submission, peer-review, editing and author proofing workflows can operate on the same source document, streamlining the entire publication process.</p>\n          <p>A Document ARchive (.dar) is essentially a zip archive, containing the manuscript as a standard JATS XML file, as well as additional assets such as images and data files. It is built around the following design goals:</p>\n          <List>\n            <ListItem headline='Standard-compliant'>\n              Structured article content are stored as JATS, the de facto standard for archiving and interchange of scientific open-access contents with XML.\n            </ListItem>\n            <ListItem headline='Machine-readable'>\n              DAR is designed for machine readability.
