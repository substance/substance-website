                        <p class="sc-paragraph">We designed Substance for <strong class="sc-strong">scientists</strong> who want to self-publish their findings rapidly, <strong class="sc-strong">researchers</strong> in the private sector, as well as <strong class="sc-strong">students</strong> for writing a thesis or seminar paper. You can use Substance for any other content too. It is not limited to research.</p>

                        <p class="sc-paragraph">Soon. While most parts are in place, we need a couple of months more to work out the kinks.

                        <p class="sc-paragraph">Substance is the first self-publishing solution for research. It supports all stages, from <strong class="sc-strong">writing</strong> the manuscript, to <strong class="sc-strong">reviewing</strong> and <strong class="sc-strong">editing</strong> to rapid <strong class="sc-strong">sharing</strong> and public <strong class="sc-strong">discussion</strong>.</p>
                        <p class="sc-paragraph">Our minimal user interface provides an excellent experience for editing and reading. Changes to an article are available in <strong class="sc-strong">real-time</strong>.

                        <p class="sc-paragraph">Michael Aufreiter, Oliver Buchtala and Daniel Beilinson have been working in the field for the past seven years and developed <strong class="sc-strong">open-source editor software</strong> to help open access journals speed up their publishing process.</p>
                        <p class="sc-paragraph">We realised that this is not enough. Researchers want to become genuinely independent, so they can establish a new friendly way for <strong class="sc-strong">sharing</strong> and <strong class="sc-strong">discussing</strong> their findings <strong class="sc-strong">ahead of journal publication</strong>. We want to take out all the annoying bits and make communicating science fun and productive. That&#x2019;s our mission!</p>

                    <div class="se-answer">
                        <p class="sc-paragraph">No. Substance is more like an interactive preprint server, but holding <strong class="sc-strong">dynamic web publications</strong> rather than static PDF&#x2019;s. We provide the technical solution, while authors are responsible for the content.</p>

                        <p class="sc-paragraph">In Substance, you invite reviewers and editors openly. You can reach high-quality content by publishing corrected revisions as you receive feedback.</p>
                        <p class="sc-paragraph">Publishers can benefit from Substance too. Instead of discussing a PDF submission, they can assess an article directly on Substance and have their editors and reviewers interact with the content directly.</p>
